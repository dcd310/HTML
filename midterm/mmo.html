        <h3>5. RuneScape</h3>
        <p>Once a king in the MMORPG scene, <i>RuneScape</i> has fallen to the 5th spot on this list. When released in 2011, the game quickly took over the gaming scene with the amount of subscribers and players. It was noted on the Guinness World Records book as once the biggest free-to-play MMORPG. There have been many patches over the years the game has been live for that keeps the players coming back for more. With 26 different skills to master, player versus player game mode, and countless events throughout the year, RuneScape is still a game not to be overlooked.

        <h3>4. The Elder Scrolls Online </h3>
        <p>
            Taking the 4th spot on this top 5 list is <i>The Elder Scrolls Online</i>. The game has quite a bit of controversy due to most of its popularity coming from one of its offline brothers <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/skyrim" target="_blank"><i>Skyrim</i></a>. Nonetheless, the game is still great and popular. It is available on many different consoles which is not offered by many other MMORPGs. Although there are no clear numbers on how many active players there are, a summation of different results puts us near 800k and is still increasing.

        <h3>3. Guild Wars 2</h3>
        <p>
            ArenaNet's <b>FREE</b> <i>Guild Wars 2</i> was hit with a new patch called Heart of Thorns and gave the game a quick uprising in popularity. People love this game due to its free-to-play aspect and how it relys on a lot of teamwork in order to complete different missions. In addition to all the community building aspects, the game is also very noob friendly (but it does not lack on high-end gameplay due to PVP). If <i>Guild Wars 2</i> continues to spit out patches with new content, it is sure to keep the high population of players.

        <h3>2. Final Fantasy XIV</h3>
        <p>
            The MMO version of the Final Fantasy series that Square Enix released takes the second seed away. The Final Fantasy series has always had a dedicated fanbase. The game features great graphics, huge terrains, and a wide variety of monsters to fight. I would have to say that FFXIV is a must-try for any Final Fantasy fans out there. With 1.5 million active players and a boasted 5 million accounts, FFXIV stays as the second most active MMORPG.

        <h3>1. World of Warcraft</h3>
        <p>Although <i>WoW</i> could not even make the PC's top 5 list, it is no surprise that WoW is still the leader in number of players. We can only assume the playerbase of WoW to continuously increase with the newest patches adding in even more content for older and newer players to enjoy. Maybe we will see WoW return to the top of the tops in game popularity and take back it's throne!

            <br>
            <br> Warcraft also released a movie this year known as
            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803096/" target="_blank"><i><b>Warcraft</b></i></a>. It's pretty good for a fantasy!
        </p>

        <br>
        <p id="conclusion">These top 5 games although all different in many aspects, also have a similar quality of requiring players to work together to complete different missions. MMORPGs can be played for users to compete against each other but the most successful seems to be when the playerbase gets to work together to beat different missions. If you're ever feeling the need to play a game with a friend, these are for you!

        <h3>Honorable Mention: Tera <i>and</i> Blade &amp; Soul</h3>
        <p><i>Tera and Blade &amp; Soul</i> both have similar artwork and playstyles but they never really made it big in the Western side of the world. Most of the playerbase comes from Asia where the WuXia-style that these games follow are more popular. These games, although not in the top 5 still have great mechanical requirements and have topnotch graphics.
