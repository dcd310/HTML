        <h3>2. Hearthstone</h3>
        <p>Here we have yet another Blizzard game making the list! And this one beats out <i>Overwatch</i> by nearly 40 million players. <i>Hearthstone </i>has 50 million players logging in around the world, which puts <i> Hearthstone </i>lightyears above the three games above in combined popularity.</p>

        <p id="conclusion"><b><i>So</i></b>, what's the main take from this information? Blizzard and valve really know what they're doing with their gaming production by having released 3/5 of the top games. League, although it stands as an "ancient" game now, still has the biggest fanbase. AND, if you have not yet started on any of the top 5 games and are in a search for something fun to play, you should really get started!</p>

        <h3>Honorable mention: World of Warcraft</h3>
        <p>Once the most popular game, <i> World of Warcraft</i> (commonly known as WOW) has taken a beating over the past few years and lost many fans and subscribers. However, <i>WoW's</i> popularity rose a bit with <i>OverWatch's</i> new release. Currently, <i>WoW</i> still has an enormous amount of 170 thousand diehard active fans playing each month. <i>WoW</i> was released in 2004 as the fourth game of the Warcraft series.

            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803096/" target="_blank"><i><b>Warcraft</b></i></a>. It's pretty good for a fantasy!
