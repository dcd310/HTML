        <h3>5. The Game of Life: 2016 Edition</h3>

        <p><i>Life</i> was originally a board game where players pick different routes and end up making miniature life decisions. I used to always play this game when I was younger so it brings back nostalgic memories. This iPhone version bring newer updates with different minigames and more realistic graphics. It's definitely a game for families and friends to play!

        <h3>3. Plants vs. Zombies</h3>
        <p><i>Plants vs. Zombies</i> is basically a classic game now. Everyone has played it and everyone has heard of it. What keeps it so great though is what you may ask yourself. The sandbox mode and the replay possibilities of the levels makes the game ever-so-enjoyable. Go get your share of brains now!</p>

        <h3>2. Heads Up!</h3>
        <p>HEADS UP! This game was originally played on the Ellen Degeneres show and quickly gained popularity in the mobile scene. It's a very party friendly game that lets friends group up and play against each other. It is very nice to see an interactive game in the top 5 where people have to communicate to play!</p>

        <h3>1. MineCraft Pocket Edition</h3>
        <p><i>MineCraft Pocket Edition</i>, like the desktop version is a sandbox game where the user is allowed to make whatever he/she wants. From huge towers to fun rollercoasters, whatever the users imagine, they can make it. With the infinite possibility background, the players would never get bored of the game, thus keeping it at the #1 spot for a long time.</p>

        <h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
        <p id="conclusion">From the top 5 games, we can see that gamers usually like to stick to the sandbox-esque game type. By having infinite possibilities in the game, it essentially transform into the all-powerful and fun game. If there are any newer game designers, keep that in mind but don't let the ZOMBIES take your brain away!</p>

        <h3>Honorable Mention: Bloons TD 5</h3>
        <p>The unPOPPABLE series Bloons still has a placeholder as one of the top iPhone games. I mean, who doesn't love cute monkeys who can throw darts perfectly at balloons?The game requires tactical decision making and lots of replay value. The only reason why the game has fallen out of the top 5 is probably due to the fact that there hasn't been a big patch or a newer version released.</p>
